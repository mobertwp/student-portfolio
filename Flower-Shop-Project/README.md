This is a web development project i've done with my team back in March 2021.  
It's a web-app purposely made as a flower shop with online transaction and also transaction report generation.  
It uses ASP.NET framework and follow a DDD software development philosophy.  
Although it lacks some CSS styling, this project mostly teaches me about the mindset of DDD and guide me to follow a standard and appropriate pattern to software development. This mindset ultimately increases coordination between projects member, flexibility and maintainability of the program, and also improve communication between member.
