In a 4 month Scrum Roleplay project done in March 2021, i participated in a team of 6 of Scrum Team.
As a Scrum Master, i initiate meetings and project discussion, facilitate and documents the meetings + daily scrum, and provide consulting and feedbacks for the project.
This roleplay project enhance my understanding of the framework in Scrum Methodology, the roles of Scrum Team member and what responsibilities of each role in a Scrum Team need to fulfill.
